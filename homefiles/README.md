# DotFiles Task 2
* I chose 10 aliases from the awesome aliases. Most of which were simple ones like '..' for `cd ..` or `gaa` for `Git Commit -A`. Simple but saved me time while doing this assignment.
  * I created the `.bash_aliases` file and threw them all in there.   
* For my script I chose to make the symlink for my `.bash_aliases`

### Citations
* Only used this one to refresh the syntax for Symlink.
