# Task 3

For this assignment I chose to install CUDA. I just had to install it for Windows so I figured might as well do it from the command line now.






Sources:
  * For checking the package manager I used the google generated response. I searched "bash script check system package manager"
  * I used [this guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/) to help with the installation. I did omit some verification steps. It also directed me to [this website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=Ubuntu&target_version=24.04&target_type=deb_local) and once I selected all my options it told me what commands to run.
